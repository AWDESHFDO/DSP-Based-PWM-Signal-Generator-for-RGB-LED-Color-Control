This project focuses on the design and implementation of a PWM signal generator using the TI Delfino DSP controller to control the intensity of an RGB LED through precise duty-cycle modulation. The objective was to generate synchronized PWM signals for each color channel (Red, Green, and Blue) and create a smooth, repeating color pattern by adjusting the duty cycles dynamically.

The experiment utilized ePWM1A, ePWM2A, and ePWM7B modules configured in up-count mode with no prescaling and a system clock frequency of 200 MHz. The timer period (TBPRD) was calculated as 4999, ensuring an accurate PWM frequency. Each PWM output (GPIO0, GPIO2, and GPIO13) was assigned to one color channel of the RGB LED. Separate initialization functions were developed for each PWM module, and synchronization was achieved by disabling and re-enabling the time-base clock during setup.

In the second phase, three duty-cycle variables—duty_red, duty_green, and duty_blue—were dynamically varied in real-time to produce continuous color transitions. A variable named sector determined the sequence of color change, while a 0.2-second delay between updates ensured smooth color blending. The RGB LED exhibited seamless transitions through various color combinations, validating the correct operation of the PWM control.

Additionally, deadband configuration was implemented to introduce rising edge delay in the PWM signals. By modifying the risingEdgeDelay variable, the effect of phase shift between channels was analyzed both visually on the oscilloscope and through LED color changes. This demonstrated the system’s ability to apply precise timing control and observe the effect of dead-time on multi-channel PWM outputs.

The project successfully demonstrated how DSP-based PWM control can be applied for color mixing, timing adjustment, and synchronized waveform generation with minimal CPU intervention. The results verified that varying the duty cycles and deadband parameters directly affects LED intensity, color blending, and synchronization, highlighting the efficiency and precision of the ePWM modules on the Delfino DSP platform.
